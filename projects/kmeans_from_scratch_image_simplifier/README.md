# Image Segmentation – K-Means Clustering (python)

![K-Means Image Segmentation Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Federico-CM/ml_experiments/main/projects/kmeans_from_scratch_image_simplifier/k_means_info.png)


## What is this?
This project contains a script (Python) that implements K-means clustering from scratch and performs image segmentation.
The goal is simple: Given an image, can we group pixels into K groups based on how similar they are by color, and produce a segmented version of the image?

## Why is this interesting?
This project shows how a computer can learn to sort things into categories based on measurable traits.
In everyday terms, this is the same kind of task used in:

- Image compresion
- Customer segmentation
- Market basket analysis
- Medical diagnosis support
- Natural language processing

## What does this project show?
This project is an example of:
- How a commonly used algorithm works under the hood
- How computers can group similar data points into clusters
- How an image can be treated like a dataset (each pixel is a data row)
- How unsupervised learning works (no labeled “correct answer” needed)

# Technical Stuff
## How do I execute the code?
Make sure that the script is in the same location as the picture before executing it.
To run the script you’ll need these libraries:

numpy
matplotlib
skimage

To install them, execute:
pip3 install numpy matplotlib scikit-image

## How do I interpret the results?
The script produces two images: the original image and a segmented version where the number of colors has been reduced. The segmentation works by grouping similar colors together and replacing them with a representative color, which simplifies the overall image. Instead of using thousands or millions of colors, the image is recreated using only K main colors. When K is small, the image looks more simplified and “poster-like,” and some fine details may be lost. When K is larger, the segmented image looks much closer to the original because more color variation is preserved.
